# UAB Contest
## General
This repository provides a series of handy algorithms implemented in Python.
The problems can be found in <a href="ProgProbs.pdf">ProgProbs.pdf</a>.

## Goals
The goal of this project is to provide simple but efficient implementations for common
programming problems. The code should not be too complicated or long and should be
sufficiently commented in order to teacht he reader something about underlying concepts.
